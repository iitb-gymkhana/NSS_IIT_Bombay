            We get to learn a lot of things here! I have been coming in IIT to
            learn from Bhaiyas and Didis from NSS since I was in 8th grade. Now
            I am studying in 10th grade. NSS Volunteers really teach so well
            that we understand most of the things and help us do well in exams.
            My younger sister too comes to learn Maths and Science from NSS
            volunteers. Not only academics, they also teach us Arts and Craft,
            Dance, Drama in Muskaan sessions and some really interesting
            experiments in Prayog session. Participating in all these sessions
            is so much fun!

            Often, it is not until your adult life that you go through some of
            your most valuable events. For instance, some may find their time in
            the military to be of utmost importance to them, while others
            sometimes find that their experience as a parent was the most
            rewarding one theyâ€™ve had. Personally though, I consider my time in
            green campus as my most valuable experience yet. On the first Day,
            completely drenched in rain ,all the Members of the NSS, GC reached
            Campus Hub for a "Sapling Collection Drive".Apart from being a fun
            activity, I met some of my best friends in the institute right here
            in Green Campus. My most memorable experience was the visit to
            Sameer Hills. We took water and manure with us and climbed all the
            way up. It was very tiring but so much fun as we all were together.
            The AAs kept motivating us and this led us all the way up to the
            top. We dug a hole and planted a tree in it.

          <p>
            The naxal-affected Giridih district in Jharkhand has started an
            e-learning initiative (Disha Giridih) for its students to educate
            them in the absence of Government teachers and that videos on our
            YouTube channel, OLI were helping them provide regional language
            content to the students. On interaction with them, the Web-learning
            Coordinator of Giridih had the following to say: "Most of the
            students belong to rural areas and govt Hindi medium schools. Videos
            from OLI NSS are totally apt for them as the content is presented in
            Hindi in verbal as well as in written format. Also,the content is
            presented in a very simple manner and it helps our students get the
            basic concepts....students can ask questions to their teachers and
            due to local language they can even discuss issues among their
            friends...As per our monthly assessment report, there is a huge
            demand of new videos from students as well as teachers. Students are
            very much excited because of the e-learning initiative and their
            attendance has increased due to such initiatives."

            Seeing my kids perform on stage in Abhinay brought tears of
            happiness to my eyes! All my efforts for their education are worth
            it! I would like to thank NSS for playing a crucial role in my kids'
            progress.

            The topics were very relevant for the students. We like that you
            guys do this much amount of effort for our students. Since there are
            students of 3 standards at the same time in Assembly hall, there was
            some lack of discipline, but he you do it in class, then it can be
            more effective because students will be more attentive in class. -
