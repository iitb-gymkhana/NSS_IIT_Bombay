<p>We are not permanent IIT workers and have been fighting for workplace safety and social justice for the past 3 years.Two of my colleagues passed away last year on duty because IIT hospital refused to treat them.I work my ass-off every day for 9-10 hours to provide service to campus residents and all I expect is to be treated like a dignified human being.I came from a poor family of farmers in a remote part of Maharashtra and even though I am not much educated, I always tell my child that education is the most important thing.I started working at the age of 14 due to poor financial conditions and had to drop out of school. <br /> I have a dream that my child also becomes an IITian like you guys and that is what keeps me and my wife going !</p>
<p>I have a 12 hour long work duration.I&#039;m doing this work for first time here.My parents live in Vidarbha and are farmers. Many people from my town work here, so do I. Economic conditions make me do this work.I work as well as study! I&#039;m doing first year of my degree education right now. Admission has been taken at college in my town and I go there just to give my exams.</p>
<p>My husband drives an autorickshaw. I have been working in IIT Bombay since 7 years, the work is quite hectic but I have no choice.I don’t have computer literacy and may be that’s why I have to toil it out day in day out. We are not entitled to any medical facilities here.I have a young daughter. She goes to school. There is no discrimination there. Everyone behaves nicely.</p>
<p>I have been living here for almost a decade now due to the constant rise in construction works in the campus.We live in a place very close to dumpyard and that’s the playground for our children. Diseases like malaria,dengue and viral fever are common for us.We don&#039;t have a holiday on Diwali. We get a day off on Dusshera though. Sunday is also a holiday but we prefer to work to get that extra day’s wage.My daughter can’t hear or speak and I have to go to outside hospitals to get her the treatment and since me and my wife both are at work we are unable to get proper medical treatment for our child.</p>
<p>I am originally from Jammu and Kashmir. My father shifted to Mumbai a long time back. We used to visit our grandparents during school vacations. The weather in Kashmir is so nice and cold, I loved it there. But, haven’t visited there since marriage. My husband also works here in IIT as a carpenter. Now that I have two young kids, I hope they grow up to be like you people. I admire how students here study, stay away from home to build their future to eventually help their parents. I like the way they manage everything so beautifully without any parental support. You guys are obedient and would have taken advice of elders seriously.Papa always scolded me to study hard, but I just ignored him and see the result today. I don’t want the same to happen with my kids.</p>
<p>I spent my entire childhood in IIT Bombay campus. My father used to work here but he is retired now. I studied till class 10th and then had to dropout of education for various reasons.I have been working here since 21 years. I like this place as it is calm and quiet. Everyone in my family has had their entire education in Marathi medium. But now, my two children attend St. Zavier’s school and I feel proud that I have been able to provide quality education to them. What I like most about working at IIT Bombay is that I get a chance to witness <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/iitb.moodindigo/?fref=mentions">Mood Indigo, IIT Bombay</a> and <a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/iitbombaytechfest/?fref=mentions">Techfest, IIT Bombay</a> every year since I help the organizers in managing their events held at SOM.The students are quite humble in their behaviour. There is an incident which I&#039;ll always remember - Once a student was very tired and was roaming around in frustration. It was lunch time so I invited him to have lunch with me. He joined me happily without any hesitation.I liked the gesture of equality he potrayed !</p>
<p>I want to open a coffee shop in Darjeeling, just like BrewBerries! Just a coffee machine and a refrigerator will do as finding a place is not a problem there. I started working here nine months ago, before that I worked in several hotels of Mumbai. The customers in hotels were very rude sometimes. But here students treat me like family. Even my boss is from IIT Bombay and he is just too good! The work also is very peaceful here, nothing hectic. Taking a holiday or coming late to work is seldom a problem. Sir is very cooperative.<br /> All this while I have been working to save money in order to set up my own coffee shop. Papa is a driver in Darjeeling and mom works in a bank. I&#039;ll get married as soon as I settle down in life. <br /> As a child I hated studies and read only till class 10th. After that, &quot;feel hi nahi aayi&quot;.<br /> And I don&#039;t regret my decision at all. I am happy with what I am today. I play guitar sometimes... that feels good !</p>
<p>I have been working in IIT Bombay since 23 years and it feels as if I have spent my entire life here. I have never faced problems with my job except the petty issues which arise occasionally. Everyone has problems, who doesn&#039;t ? The secret to happiness lies in looking at the big picture ! My family is well settled. My elder daughter is pursuing medical sciences,currently in her final year MBBS and is going to graduate soon.The younger one is getting free education in  Kendriya Vidyalaya and is doing just fine. I am a relieved man with no worries.My daughters are my world and I am proud of them !</p>
<p>“I keep laughing most of the time. Laughter has kept me going all these years. Even at work people tell me, you keep laughing all 24 hours. I say, life is God’s gift to us, he has sent us down to smile, not to cry, right? My journey has been full of challenges from the beginning. I have been working from the time when I came to Mumbai, in 1978 at the age of 21. First as a contract labourer, then tried my hand at business. After suffering losses in it, I started working as a BEST bus conductor.  For me, life has been like playing hide and seeks with sunshine and shadow. One can’t always expect shadow, you have to face the heat at times; the key is in enjoying the sunshine as well. Today God has given us everything we could have asked for. I get a decent salary here, which is used for my children’s education. Now, after so much of hard work, I have relaxed a little, but not fully. Till my children start earning, I have to keep working.”</p>
<p>I’m Dilwar Nishaad originally from a small village called Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh. We are a total of eight siblings, four brothers and four sisters. My father’s salary was the only source of income in our house, and hence due to poor financial conditions, I had to quit studies in 4th standard.  I came to Mumbai, four years ago at the age of 16 to join my elder brother as a canteen worker in an upcoming building in Hiranandani. After switching many jobs in the nearby areas, I started to work here at sunrise. Our house runs with the help of my brothers and my earnings.  I’m happy that due to my job, my younger siblings have the chance to complete their education, an opportunity I and my brother had to give up.</p>
<p>“My grandfather worked in IIT for 38 years.  I remember coming to the campus riding a bicycle when I was a kid. Those days SAC office used to be between hostel 8 and hostel 11. I’m working here since 1998. One of the best things about my job is that I get to work with such a wide variety of amazing students, many well qualified people outside the campus do not have this privilege that I do. But a major disadvantage is that, I hardly have any holidays. Even during lunch, if a student calls me, I come rushing, because students are my top priority. I wish we were provided with more staff, since the number of students and activities keeps growing year by year, but staff stays the same. Nevertheless, I can provide my three daughters a good education with this job, and that’s what keeps me contented.”</p>
<p>I used to work in a Courier Company when my friend recommended me for a vacant post here.  At that time, the new lecture hall complex was just built, and my job was to handle the classes, and mend the required electrical equipments. I had to discontinue studies after 10th standard, owing to stressful financial situations at home. To clear loans and support my family, I started with whatever job I could find. One major trouble I face is that we hardly have any job security. A single error and there’s a chance that we lose our jobs.  Also we aren’t eligible for any of the medical facilities that the institute provides. Apart from this, life is going on smoothly. The salary I receive is sufficient for a decent livelihood. We finally have been relieved of all our debts.</p>
<p>&quot;What motivates you?&quot;<br /> &quot;The hope that one day even my kids will come to buy corn from me as IITians&quot;</p>
<p>“Tell us about your most memorable moment?”<br /> “I’ve enjoyed every moment of the 30 years I spent here. But two moments stand out, winning the Best Worker Award in the Golden Jubilee year of IITB, and the setting up of the IIT Gandhinagar library, wherein I had a major contribution. There have also been some memorable, but not happy moments. Like once, my wife was hospitalized, but I just wasn’t able to visit her”<br /> “But why?”<br /> “My shift hadn’t ended. Just couldn’t leave the students unattended”<br /> “Yeah, we know that you love your students a lot. Any message for them?”<br /> “I’ve always referred to them as my children. I always urge them to ‘waste’ at least one hour of the day at the library. I would just like to tell them one thing: The institute has given you a lot, and you should give it something back in return. It’s your responsibility. And also, stay in touch. Seeing mails from ex-students, asking me how I’m doing, or thanking me for the help, makes me the happiest”</p>
<p>“How did you decide to become a prof?”<br /> “Actually, when I graduated, I was too young for a job (laughs). By the time I was 19, I had graduated with BE in Civil Engineering! Those days, the minimum age requirement for government jobs was 21 and hence, I wasn&#039;t eligible for any of those jobs. So I made up my mind to pursue higher education. I completed my masters from IISc Bangalore and did my PhD in Canada, and then joined decided to join as faculty in IIT Bombay in 1977.”</p><p> “What do you love the most about your profession?”<br /> “One of the most wonderful aspect of teaching at IITB, as I feel, is the freedom offered to the professors. I am 73 now and officially should have been retired at age of 63. This academic year would conclude my 50 years in the field of teaching. And this is what I love about teaching, you can continue it for as long as you want to.&quot;</p><p> P.S: Prof. Pani is not exactly an &quot;Invisible” Human of IITB. However, since he completes his golden jubilee this year as a prof, and we are in the Teachers&#039; day week, we thought that we might as well show his story to the campus residents.</p>
<p>“It is quite a long time that you’ve been here.”<br /> “Yes ! I have been here since 2002. We are two people and we alternatively take care of the shop in shifts from 8am to 5pm and 12pm to 11pm”<br /> “So, where do you stay ?”<br /> “I live in Kalyan and travel everyday. It takes me about an hour each side.”<br /> “Then, what’s your inspiration to travel this distance everyday ? As, we’ve never seen this shop closed. When all the others are closed, this shop is there to serve the purpose.”<br /> “When the shop is closed, lots of students call up asking when I am going to come.The only reason this shop is open on Sunday’s too is to meet the students’ requirement. So that whenever they remember their assignments in the eleventh hour, they have someone to their rescue.”</p>
<p>&quot;I work 8 hours a day so that one day, I can buy my own room for me and my family&quot;</p><p> Meet Pramod Tayde, a man you might be familiar with if you play badminton at the Gymkhana courts. He lives in Bhandup in a rented room along with his wife and 2 children, and has worked for 9 years at IITB. Working in a shift of 8 hours at a time everyday without a holiday is tiring, he says, but perseveres in order to fulfill his dreams of completing his children&#039;s education. In his free time he reads, and also likes playing badminton. He is a man who is still very eager to learn, and also occasionally plays a match with anyone who is waiting for a partner.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you take up auto-rickshaw driving?&quot;<br /> &quot;13 years ago, the chemical industry I worked in shut down. I did not have the option to lose hope. My wife was working in H2 mess. So I started serving the students here as well, by driving an auto in the campus late at night.&quot;</p><p> &quot;What are your memorable moments with the students?&quot;<br /> &quot;The students often remember me when they want to shoot a scene with an auto, for their GCs etc. And be it emergency, hunger, or film-making, I&#039;m always happy to help&quot;</p>
<p>Meet Mr. Arjun, more commonly known as the Dhobi of Hostel 2. He has been associated with clothes pretty much all his life. He used to work at a textile mill in Gandhinagar since he was a teenager, and came to Mumbai with the hopes of earning more to support his family. He works 14 hours a day, without the slightest hint of entertainment. He is distant from the concept of friendship, and feels that talking to someone would hinder his efficiency at work. Though it is evident that he is delighted by whatever small talks he has with the students. When asked about his motivation to still keep working, he said, &quot;I am uneducated, and I don’t want my children to meet the same fate. My dream is to see my two sons and two daughters studying in Kendriya Vidyalay, IIT Powai.&quot;</p>
<p>“We got this place on 28th Feb and I started Campus Hub on 19th March. The place that we got was just plain concrete. The entire outlet was erected, painted, set up- everything was done it 29 days, so that was one of the best things efforts in the campus in terms of erecting an outlet.”</p><p> This week we introduce Mr. <span class="_39_n profileLink">Neelesh Patodi</span>, owner of some of the most happening places on campus, the food joints- Brew N Bites and The Campus Hub. Mr. Neelesh, an IIT Bombay alumnus (batch of 2007- Electrical Engg, DD in Microelectronics), is a determined person with acute business sense.</p><p> “What motivated you to start Brewberry and The Campus Hub?”<br /> “Why I did this and why I’m still doing this is because I knew that the food scene on the campus was bad. Being an alum, I knew what to sell and what not to sell.”</p><p> “What is the story behind The Campus Hub?”<br /> “It would become a hub for the students as it was at a very good location, hence, the name ‘The Campus Hub’- It was envisioned to be the life of the campus. We got this place on 28th Feb and ….”</p>
<p>&quot;I have been working here for the last 7 years. The shift is for 8 hours a day, which generally extends to 9 hours. The usual schedule is to wake up at 4 in the morning, complete the household chores by 6 a.m. and later, leave for work from home at Bhandup. The work environment is very warm and pleasant. All the co-workers have become very good friends.We are like a family discussing all our problems and helping each other.Everything here has become a part of my life to the extent that I often miss work during holidays.I am greatful to Radha Didi (H10 resident) who convinced the Dean to make an exception to the general rule and got our children admitted to Kendriya Vidyalaya even though we are employed on contract basis.We don’t get salary on time is my only complain.I have two kids.My biggest inspiration to work is that my children study well and have great achievements in life and get a good white collar jobs for themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>“Times have been tough, but I have survived through them and things look better now.”</p><p> Rohit Chile, 24 years old, is one of the two Technical Assistants at the Tinkerer’s Lab of IIT Bombay. Working here for almost two years, he landed up at Tinkerer’s Lab through an interview followed by a few months of trial. Having a diploma in Mechanical Engineering, it was tough for him to figure out all the electrical components and solve the problems of the students visiting the lab. With time he learnt a lot from the “smart students” and became efficient at his work.</p><p> He lives in Kanjurmarg with his father, who is in the Navy dock, his mother, a homemaker, and his sister who is an Accountant. Back at school he used to spend his day playing cricket and tinkering away in his father’s garage. His hopes of a life of cricket was discouraged by his father, so he chose his second favourite thing, machines. He states, “Mujhe apne haath kaale karna accha lagta hai.”</p><p> He got his diploma from a college in Nagpur and wanted to pursue further studies. Right then his father fell very ill, so it was upon him to support his family. He rented a place to set up his own garage and the business went very well. Seeing this, the owner of the place decided to take back the place along with the business which left Rohit without a source of income. So he took his resume to the Machine Tools lab of IIT Bombay and bagged a job.</p><p> He says, “Times have been tough, but I have survived through them and things look better now. The past 8 years of my life have made me a mature person and I now am confident that I can get through every difficulty that life has to offer.”</p><p> His dad is now well and has returned back to his job. Rohit still plays cricket in his free time and wants to set up his own business soon.</p>
<p>&quot;काम हाथ में लिया है तो दिल लगा के करो!&quot;<br /> Meet Mr. Pritesh Yadav, Assistant Sports Officer, Gymkhana, IIT Bombay. One of the coolest man on campus who uses IITB lingo and is passionate about sports and fitness, with a vision to create an atmosphere of the same in whole of the institute.<br /> He has gained a lot of respect from his disciples in the three years he has devoted to this institute, and rightly so, as he has shaped the whole team of volleyball from scratch.<br /> In the short interview he talks about a range of things, from his experience in the campus, to his edification for the students and people in general. He has a firm belief that the students here have immense potential packed in them, but their egos come in between them making it flourish. Apart from the students, he also extends his concerns about the kids on the campus, and makes them play a sport instead of just roaming around and procrastinating. According to him, this will bring about a change by adding a routine in their lives.<br /> In the end, he just adds that he will be available to guide any person provided one has the will to learn.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you work for all seven days in a week?&quot;</p><p> &quot;My dream is to give my kids a good education, a platform which will support them and help them go higher in life. If not for overtime, almost all my salary would go into paying the rent of the room in which I stay with my family, just outside the IIT campus.&quot;</p>
<p>It’s a feast to our eyes and mind, looking at pretty flowers. Such mesmerizing moments are brought by these friends of nature, more commonly known as the Gardeners of IITB.<br /> Some of them are Mr.Raman(right) and Mr.Gopal(left) who are serving tirelessly in the beautification of the campus of IIT Bombay for 37 years and 16 years respectively.</p>
<p>End semester examinations are going on and we only know how many pages are left blank in our answer books. Well, meet Prof. S.B. Kedare from Energy Science and Engineering department who has been reusing those blank pages in your answer books for his personal works! He has been reusing papers from various sources and his story is truly worth knowing.</p><p> &quot;Where do you get these papers from?&quot;<br /> &quot;I generally get them from Mechanical Dept office or Energy dept office and Xerox room. I have been taking out the blank pages in End semester exam answer booklets and assignments submitted by students as well.&quot;</p><p> &quot;Where do you use these papers?&quot;<br /> &quot;I first categories them into print quality and non-print quality papers. I use the print quality papers for printing the assignments, exam/quiz papers and some less important letters inside institute. I write notes on non-printable paper for my lectures. My daughter also uses them as rough pages. I use fresh papers only in the places like giving letter of appreciation where these reused paper may not look good. I had bought 2 packs of the new A4 pages long back and have been using one of them. One pack is still unopened since 8 years lying in my cupboard&quot;</p><p> &quot;What do you do with the used papers then?&quot;<br /> &quot;Instead of using the black plastic bags, I use these used papers to line the dustbins from inside. I sometimes use those for packaging or sell to raddiwala.&quot;</p><p> &quot;How long have you been practicing this?&quot;<br /> &quot;I started doing it when I was a B.Tech student here in IIT during 1980s.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone knows regarding recent flooding in low lying areas of campus and here we introduce you to the head of IITB Security staff and his efforts on the fateful day of 29 August. With 20 years of experience at the Indian Air Force, Mr. Ganesha Murugan decided to join the IITB security force as its head in 2011, because he loves to be among the students. Currently pursuing his Ph.D. from Pune University, Mr. Murugan holds an MBA in Human Resource Management. </p><p> When he got to know about the heavy rainfall predicted by the Meteorological Department, Mr. Murugan scrambled his workforce to remain alert in the low-lying areas of Hostels 7 and 9. His timely alert to the Estate Department regarding the rising water levels in the Powai Lake allowed them to prepare for flooding in some parts of the campus. He thus helped in mitigating the tragic effects of the heavy downpour.</p><p> When asked about what drives him towards sacrificing his personal life for the safety of the students, he says with a bright face, “You can only give your 50% when you work for the organization, but it is when the organization works for you that you can do selfless service.”</p><p> The happiest moments of his life are when he sees students during the convocation hugging the security guards of their hostels and thanking them for their service and support.</p>

<p>“What motivates you to work for 17 hours a day?”<br /> “...mehnat nahi karenge toh aage kaise badhenge!”</p><p> Meet Mr.Shankar Gupta, aged 21 years, who serves in a night canteen in the lecture hall complex of IIT Bombay. Coming from a small village in Uttar Pradesh, he has been tirelessly serving the students in the night canteen, working from 8 pm to 8 am, everyday. However, this kind of work schedule doesn’t stop him from continuing his studies. He never misses his classes in the evening and then studies before coming to his workplace. He aspires to take up medical studies and is preparing for the same. Smiling gently, he says, “...mujhe khud ki kamaai se padhna hai, khud ke pairon par khada hona hai.”</p>
<p>Ever wondered who comes to fix those electricity related issues in the academic area? <br /> Meet Mr. Ravindra Mestry, aged 34 years old, he has been serving us for more than 7 years.  He works in electrical subsection office outside GG Building. He completed his studies from New English School and then from DAV College till 12th. He started his career working at Sandoz and then under MIDC. He lives in Bhandup with his wife and a child. Sometimes he has to work here for 15 hours. In spite of this, he works overtime so that he can spend time with his family. When asked about his hobbies, admiringly he says, ”I still remember those days playing cricket with my friends”. He plans to move on to bigger and better jobs and get his own contract one day.</p>
<p>&quot;Some goals are so worthy, it’s glorious even to fail.”</p><p> This Army Day, we take immense pleasure and honour to introduce you to an army personnel and an NCC Officer Hav. Vinod Sakpal sir residing in IITB. Apparently, he has completed 3 years of service here in IIT Bombay today. </p><p> He starts off by mentioning how impressed he is by the students of IIT and says that he has learnt a lot from them. Talking about his work as an NCC officer, he admits it being completely different from his past army experience.</p><p> With intense dedication and love for our nation, he genuinely feels that serving our country is his duty. Son of an army man, he was destined to join the army and never dreamed of becoming anything less. </p><p> When asked about the importance of family in his life, he humbly replies that “hamari life me family ka 100% importance toh nahi ho sakta, yeh bharat desh bhi apne parivaar jaisa hi toh hai!”</p><p> Principled, Determined and Humble till the end, there is no nobler being than an Army man.</p>
<p>Almost all of us have seen the main nursery of IITB. But have you ever given a thought to who takes care of so many plants growing in there? In this edition of Invisible Humans of IITB, we introduce Raman Kaka, who is the supervisor and has been working in the main nursery for the past 35 years.</p><p> Having lost his father at a very young age and being the eldest among 7 brothers and sisters, Raman Kaka had to drop out from school after Class 5 in order to work and earn for his family. Initially, he worked in a factory and came to IIT Bombay as a gardener in 1980. Since then, there was no looking back. He says, “I came here with the hope of getting a permanent job. I enjoy my work so much, the thought of leaving this place or applying for another job never crossed my mind.” His children are now well-settled and placed in government jobs. Life has come a full circle for him.</p><p> A typical day in his life begins with the maintenance of the nursery. Digging flower beds, sowing seeds, watering the plants.In spite of suffering a severe paralytic attack 3 years back, his resolve and desire to work has not weakened even a bit. When asked about how he learned to care for so many varieties of plants, he says, “I learnt it from my supervisors and teach them to my co-workers. We mainly use natural cow dung as manure and prefer not to use too many chemical fertilizers purchased from the market.”</p><p> Raman Kaka’s love for his work reflects in the way the nursery is maintained. He gives the credit to the team of workers he supervises. “I am lucky to have got such wonderful and dedicated workers with me. We work together and try our best to maintain the nursery well”, he says. He feels happy when he receives appreciation for his work from professors and students alike. “It feels great to watch the curiosity and awe of small children who visit the nursery. They get amazed seeing the wide variety of plants and trees growing here”, he says with a smile on his face.</p><p> Finally, as a message, he says that he is happy to see people’s enthusiasm for “going green” and conserving nature. “35 years back, the campus had a lot more green cover, and there were only 10-odd hostels. Now a lot has changed.</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the Institute must have come across the path between Hostel 3 and Hostel 4 which is  going to Bio-gas plant or heard about this Bio-gas plant. But have you ever thought who are handling this plant and making a lot of tones wasted mess food useful. In this edition of Invisible Humans of IITB, we introduce Akshay (Supervisor) and Sunil solanki, who look after the Bio-gas Plant.<br /> Akshay is from Ahmedabad, Gujarat and 31-year-old. Sunil is from Maharashtra and 22-year-old. They work with a four member team which handles the 2 tonnes capacity. They work 8:00 am to 5:00 pm  every  day in a  month.

There he used to purify waste water and  use it  in garden. He mentioned that working here feels so good and at the same time they face some problems too when the plant is not working.<br /> Students’ interest in knowing the details of the plant makes them very happy.<br /> From hostels,  waste is sent to plant.

Everyone should try to minimize the wastage of food.</p>
<p>In this edition of Invisible Humans, we cover the story of Mr. Yashodhara Poojary. Fondly known as Shekhar, he is the person who runs the Chemical Department canteen by his name. His simplicity and perseverance drew our attention to cover his life in a greater detail.<br /> Shekhar, originally from the city of Mangalore, completed his primary education there itself. Later on when his family shifted to Mumbai, he completed his matriculation in the city of dreams. Initially his father used to run a small tea stall in front of Y-Point gate, while he got this canteen in 2008 with the help of his uncle who is a professor in the Chemical Engineering Department.<br /> He lives with his wife, son and parents. He also has a daughter who studies physiotherapy in Mangalore while his son is enrolled in Powai English School. He works daily from 7am to 10pm, only for his children to grow up as successful people. His love for his children just cannot be explained in words.<br /> Opening of the canteen in 2008 was the turning point of his life. The dependent man turned into a dependable man who could then take care of his family.<br /> He is also one of the few people who were most enthusiastic for helping us with the Meals of Content initiative. He not only spreads awareness among his customers to contribute for meals of content but also takes care that the carton for collection is in a good condition. When asked about his motivation, he relates that when he was a child and someone used to bring chocolates, his joy would be beyond bounds. “The feeling of getting a chocolate at that time cannot be described in words” says Mr. Poojary.<br /> His observations over small details of life is appreciable.<br /> When asked about giving a message to students of IIT Bombay he humbly said that he does not have any technical knowledge but wishes students to work hard just the way he does all day and night.</p>
<p>Most of us must have seen or heard about or even attended the lectures of this “awesome” professor in MEMS department , Parag Bhargava. Ever heard about his motivations and background story?</p><p>          Well, after graduating from IIT Bombay in 1991, completing PHD from Alabama University(91-96), and after his postdoc (96-98), he started working as an assistant professor in IIT KGP in Materials Science Center. During his PHD, he started having the question of what to do next. “I don’t want a job where I have a boss”, he thought. So he thought about going into teaching.</p><p>          “During my PHD days, there was this discussion that changed my life. ‘Are you going to come back or stay?’ I wanted to come back. Most people don’t because they can’t get adjusted here again. This reason doesn’t seem appealing to me”, says Bhargava Sir. “Around the age of 26-27, I got my answer. I found an analogy with nature. It’s all in the earlier years of life. Just like how a plant’s strength depends on its earlier days, its roots,same is the case with us humans ” </p><p>          While he was having first few months in IITKGP to himself, he visited many NGOs, met a lot of people, and made a lot of network. He wanted to work with children, raise their confidence, motivate them, direct them towards creativity. 3 years later, with help of his network, and defeating great difficulties, he could start a library for children of lower income families. “India is a country with sparks, but not fire”, he says. He has done many great deeds, and has also delivered a TEDx talk.</p><p>          He loves the thought of having Libraries everywhere. He now wants to start libraries in the entire Powai for lower income families. He’s also interested in working on malnourishment. He started an app, ‘Smart Healthy Baby’ with help of one of his student, Shruti Gupta in different languages. “On an average, 3000 kids die everyday due to malnutrition. What’s our priority? Technology or malnourishment? Engineers should look at range of problems, and use their knowledge to defeat them”,  “Doing all this, it gives me too much joy! It increases my self esteem at the end of the day”, he adds.</p><p> Link for the TEDx talk: <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTonwUMZi5DU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;h=AT1N1BWk_VJ9U3HffyoQmSbm647QLV4eTAF_3eRVsEOMJnejl515IK3jPuGEj6UVr-x7zgFn4n_LYQfccnrzJurxp8IwbLiJTPbmEuQ8gQzgqJVv1qs7bIcAeqCnoTEus3o6kq6QQucpg4GX68_lXOqj30mtYQGmdRdnPr7bgZLq" target="_blank" data-ft="&#123;&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;-U&quot;&#125;" rel="nofollow" data-lynx-mode="hover">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TonwUMZi5DU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>“Koi Encourage Karne Waala Milta Hai To Pakad Lo Haath Aur Nikal Lo”. </p><p> Have you ever seen the Murals and Worli art paintings in Gulmohar restaurant and wondered who made these beautiful works of art? I’m sure many of you will be quite surprised to know who the artist is? Meet Mr. Amar Singh, a mess assistant/workman in Hostel 4. Amar Singh is an extremely talented artist and a wonderful human being who has a rousing story to tell. </p><p> &quot;I was born in IITB and completed my schooling in our campus KV school. <br /> Due to financial crisis, I couldn’t complete my higher studies and had to start working at the age of 18 with a heavy yet determined heart.<br /> After a lot of struggle, oscillating through cities and places, I applied for the post of a peon in IIT Bombay where I was offered a meagre salary of Rs 900,<br /> compared to my then current salary of Rs. 4000 which I was earning at a clerical job in Godrej. I took up the job anyway, due to various reasons,<br /> one of which was the homely feeling of the institute. I now have a permanent job at IITB. I have four kids and and despite being in a tough financial situation even today,<br /> I encourage my sons and daughters to pursue higher studies and follow their dreams. I can’t bear to let them face the same struggles that I faced in my life.&quot;</p><p> Amar Singh has been working in IITB since 1996. Many of his art works are displayed all across the institute, in Gulmohar restaurant, on KV school walls and pillars,<br /> and the AR cabin in the HCU office for which he made a painting specifically on the concept of centralization of hostels. He has also worked for PAF under Hostel 6 and made about a dozen souvenirs for Valfi.<br /> Apart from all this, he has some of his paintings showcased in Pune University also. He once got a letter of appreciation cum recommendation from a Colonel in Pune, for making a painting for him.<br /> His latest work is a Madhubani painting which he did on a saree border.</p><p> In spite of clearly being an extremely talented artist, Amar Singh is a very humble person. He has never turned his hobby into business and has kept it sacred.<br /> Life seldom goes as planned and opportunities vanish as soon as they come. One such instance was that when Amar Singh was selected in the prestigious Sir J.J. School of Arts, Mumbai, but could not go due to family reasons.<br /> Amar Singh feels that everyone gets an opportunity, you have to be there to grab it.On this note, his message to the students is -<br /> “Koi Encourage Karne Waala Milta Hai To Pakad Lo Haath Aur Nikal Lo”.</p>
<p>Many of us hit the gym regularly. The gym in old SAC is still used widely. Nearly everyone who visit the gym know the person for sure. But I’m sure that whoever visits the old SAC is familiar with this person. Meet Mr. Gautam Anandrao Ubale, the person whom you see every day outside the old gym, keeping record of equipment and student entries.<br /> “I live at Gokhalenagar, in Powai in a rental room. I used to live at Sakinaka, before working in IIT. I’m 42 years old. I studied till 7th in Asalfa Municipality School in Asalfa, Ghatkopar; and then 2 years in a private school in Asalfa. I completed 10th from NIOS 5 years ago. I plan to complete my 12th but my schedule is very busy to spare time. I live with my wife and two kids – a girl in UKG and a boy in 7th, studying in Campus School. My mother lives in Sakinaka along with my nephew and niece. Before working here, I was a tempo driver.”<br /> Gautam Ubale has been working in IIT since 2005. He works in the morning from 6 to 10 and in the evening from 4 to 12 for 15 days of the month, and from 4 to 10 in the evening for the remaining 15 days. He reaches home around 12:30am, and finishes dinner by 1:30. Then wakes up at 5:30 in the morning. With no leaves and little sleep, he still manages to do other work like taking care of the family and running errands in his afternoon break. <br /> When he first joined IIT, his initial work was to clean the SAC area for nearly 6 to 7 years as there were no housekeepers earlier. Then he worked on the Gymkhana ground for another 2 years, working in scorching sun for 8 hours a day, levelling and watering the ground. Later he shifted to SAC gym where his duties involve opening and closing the gym, keeping track that the gym is cleaned regularly by the housekeepers, maintaining the entry register and ensuring all the equipment are kept properly in place. <br /> Among many things, he loves the unity of all the students the most. He feels satisfied when many of the Graduated students still visit our insti and they talk to him whenever they do.<br /> His message to the students is- “Achhese padho aur apni progress karo, aur haan, mujhse milne aate rehna. Insaan hi insaan ke saath do shabd nahi bolega to kya hi rakha hai iss duniya mai. Koi idhar to koi udhar, koi aaj hai to koi nahi.”</p>
<p>“Dey Sir God level aadmi the”, isn’t what you would expect from probably the senior most employee in the institute, but the insti lingo has been a part of the 47 year career of Mr. Chandra Rajan. He joined the institute in 1971 when the director was Prof. A.K.Dey.  After having worked in the Main Building and LT-PCSA as a maintenance personnel, he now looks after lecture halls in SJM-SOM. This cheerful and active man is from Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu has always been a full time employee of IIT Bombay where he currently lives with his wife and daughter.<br /> “When I moved to Bombay in search of a job, with the educational qualification of having completed just the 8th standard, little did I know that I would be this close to the golden jubilee of my employment here at IITB.” With a starting income of ₹2 per day, he has seen IIT Bombay in its early stages. He fondly recalls a few occasions when the alumni of IITB, now successful professionals in their own fields would come to meet him along with their families. “ ‘Dekho ye humare Rajan bhaiyya hai’ , aisa kehte hai.”<br /> When asked about his past life in IITB, he says,”Those students were very kind to me. Students from all over the world used to call me “Rajan Bhaiyya” and it gave me immense pleasure to help them. One of the African students even gifted me his “Tape Recorder” which is still at my house.” “IIT Bombay me kaam karke mast laga. Dean, Director bahot support karte the”, is what he said while recalling his beautiful memories.</p>
<p>Meet Mr. Tanaji Bhandari who is working in SOM for 27 years, maintaining classrooms and making sure that all microphones and projectors work.<br /> Hailing  from Solapur, he left his studies after 7th standard due to lack of quality education in his village and to support his family financially. After doing some odd jobs, he moved to Mumbai in 1991 and got a job in IIT. His initial salary was 35 rs. Per day. Getting a job in IIT helped him to uplift his financial condition to some extent and also helped him to get married. When he joined IIT, he didn’t know hindi so he had communication problems but now his speaking skills have improved.<br /> His usual routine includes coming SOM at 7.30 in morning and staying till 3.45 pm and then going to his home for lunch, coming back again and staying till 9 pm. This schedule goes on for 5 days. He comes on weekends too if any classes are scheduled.<br /> On recalling his memories of his job days, he said that he has an old friend who works on first floor, with whom he used to go for tea everyday. He also recalled that students used to organise late night programs in convocations and they used to enjoy it. <br /> Recalling one of his fun experiences at IITB he said <br /> “ Pehle Convo Hall me movie dikhate the , Us samye mai aur mere dost milke movie dekhne jaate the. Bade screen me movie dekhne ka joh majha tha woh hatke tha. “ <br /> Mr. Tanaji’s family includes his wife, 2 daughters and 1 son.Both of his daughters are handicapped.And one of them is currently works in IRC department.He lives near main gate in a hut. His main motivation for work is to support his family in every way and to make sure that his children get a suitable job for their livelihood. He also mentioned that being in IIT Bombay for so many years has been a very pleasant experience for him , the students here he says are very kind and caring towards him. One of the student he says specifically came to visit him after he had graduated. This feeling he says have helped him continue his day to day work with vigour and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Inter-IIT rock Karna hai!”</p><p> Born in 1961, in Chittaranjan, West Bengal, in 1961, started his journey of Gymnastics right from 3rd Grade. He cleared the State Level Championship in 1978 but wasn&#039;t selected in the National Levels. But that didn’t stop him from becoming a State Champion and securing the second position in National Championship in the next year itself. The course was definitely not easy for him to travel. His father worked in Railways but died when he was 21 years of age. Her mother was a homemaker.</p><p> Dr. Sengupta completed his education in LNCPE, Thiruvananthapuram with MOPEd and a Ph.D. in Exercise Psychology. While his education, he did not leave his passion for table tennis and he kept taking part in local TT tournaments. He also represented his state Madhya Pradesh individually and was 3 times State Champion, 3 times National Champion and won three All India Inter-University Championship.</p><p> His first job paid him Rs.500. He joined IITB in the year 1982, for which he was paid Rs. 1500.<br /> In 1993, he became a part of IEL. He joined IITB as a coach for NSO, Gymnasium, and Inter-IIT. Under his coaching, the students of IITB successfully bagged 5 Gold Medals in the Inter-IIT Gymnastic (1988-1993). But from 1994 Gymnasium was removed from Inter-IIT. Since then he started TT coaching.</p><p> His usual routine includes a camp from 6-9 AM, the job from 9-1 PM and NSO classes from 4-9 PM.<br /> He loves to do painting in his free time. One of his paintings was showcased in an exhibition in Jehangir Art Gallery.<br /> Dr. Sengupta holds the position as the SAC Incharge. He aims to streamline the Gymkhana facilities, where there are irregularities. He wants to give his 100% to IITB students through efficient administration, and of course wants to ‘Rock in Inter-IIT’.</p>
<p>Power Supply Man:<br /> Meet Mr. MB Patel, who works as a power supply man in the library of IIT Bombay. For the last 36 years, he has devoted himself to the power supply unit of the campus. He left his studies after 9th standard to improve his family’s financial conditions. He then worked in the Blue Star, Worli for two years and then joined IIT Bombay in 1982. Talking about his area of work, he says that with the advancement in technology even he is mastering how to operate the power supply using a computer. He also emphasized the fact of deterioration of hearing capabilities with time due to regular working in noisy areas. He adds that they are so used to noises that they can even sleep in it.<br /> Mr. MB Patel has one daughter and one son. Although he did not complete his studies due to financial conditions, he always encourages his children for a better education.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been working for the past 25 years maintaining the tennis court of IIT Bombay. My father also worked here and I used to accompany him, spending most of the time of my childhood here. Initially, I used to clean the fields and do the marking in the courts.<br /> I remember how students used to call me &#039;Daddu&#039; and how I used to stay up late with the students in the SAC after it getting closed at 8 pm. It makes me happy to help students and I am always ready to help them whenever they need help. I feel that working with the students gives me joy and I treat them like my family.<br /> Being a father of three boys, I did not leave any stone unturned to complete the education of my children. My first son is graduated, the second son works in a mobile shop and the third son is an autorickshaw driver. I enjoy being in the college and feel that the environment here is great!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have been working here since I was 10. I started working initially with my father. He used to work here at the same place. I was born and brought up in Mumbai. We were 5 siblings, so it was very difficult for my father to manage our expenses, so I too started working to support my family.</p><p> Although technology didn&#039;t really help me ever in my profession, my experience of 40 years has taught me a lot. All kinds of people visit me for getting their footwear repaired. People hesitate to pay money whatever was decided according to the work. A lot of IIT students too visit me. But they are good and understanding.</p><p> I have my mother, wife and 2 daughters and a son in my family. My daughters are married. Wife and mother work as maids in our locality to support our family. All of us have to work really hard to earn bare minimum to support our family. They say times change, I am hopeful that our would change too!&quot;</p>
<p>“I have been working here since five years now. Being a civil line worker, I have been a part of building these homes for the pets and also the boundary of this beautiful pond (the one in front of Jal Vihar). In the past, I have also worked for the guest house and a garden near the Director’s bungalow, the compound wall of Hostel 8, Ananta building and the list continues. The working conditions here are far better than that of the outside world. We have fresh water, shade, and many such amenities. During Monsoon if the weather is too bad to work, we are also given an off. The risks involved are also less. But the situation of labor outside is very pathetic.”<br /> Mr. Balaji Vyankatesh Champure showed the buildings he built with a sense of pride.  But there was one thing that left us in a melancholy mood. In Spite of being in the Institute for 5 years, he hardly spoke to any students or other communities living inside the institute. When he was asked about this, he says “Everyone here is busy. I don’t want to disturb them and cause any sort of trouble.” He also adds that he being poor, couldn’t start a conversation as he thought it would be disrespectful.</p>
<p>“You get the ultimate satisfaction when you give something” said Dr. Sujala Ainapure.<br /> A lovely, cheerful woman and sports enthusiast also, who is currently a paediatrician in IIT Bombay Hospital. Dr Sujala was brought up in Bombay. Since her childhood, it was her dream to be able to help and heal people and this was the motivation that drove her towards being a doctor. She acquired the degrees of MBBS, DCH and MD(paediatrician) from TNMC Mumbai. She came to IIT Bombay for the first time to attend Mood Indigo when she was doing her first year MBBS. She liked IIT- B campus but had never imagined that she will end up being a doctor here, giving 30-year service in the IIT hospital.<br /> During the initial few years of her service, she realised that she was not able to utilise her knowledge and experience as a paediatrician to the full extent as number of children was less. During that time the cases of asthma were significant and many of them required oxygen, injections and often had to get admitted to the hospital.  It was the time when nebulizers and inhalers were just introduced.  So in 1994 she started asthma clinic to give care to this asthma patients as to reduce their misery with new techniques (nebulizers and inhalers). After starting asthma clinic and use of inhalers and nebulizers, the rate of admissions and injections dropped to less than 10% within a one year only.  She treated and still treats asthma holistically by using various ways like Yoga, Meditation, acupressure which she has found useful along with modern medicines and test. With this, curing the patients or at least bringing them under good control is not difficult. The Asthma clinic is till today regularly conducted on every Thursday Morning between 10.00 am to 1.00 pm in IIT hospital.   .<br /> Once her 5-year-old patient was diagnosed with foot paralysis and none of the medicines or multiple physiotherapy sessions tried for six months were of any use. At that time she came to know that acupuncture may help such cases. So she learnt techniques of acupuncture from the scratch just to treat the child and to her surprise, it worked&quot;.</p>
