  <section class="introduction container">
    <h1 class="header">Introduction</h1>
    <p>National Service Scheme, IIT Bombay is the most active and perseverant organization in the campus in the field
      of
      social/community service. It was established to involve students in community service and let their personality
      develop
      through it. Through various activities NSS IITB reached new heights in the academic year 2016-17, with 340
      freshmen
      volunteers enrolling in NSS, and more than 100 non-freshmen volunteers participating in the activities. The reach
      of
      the activities also expanded enormously creating the impact.</p>
    <p>Though NSS IIT Bombay is a part of curriculum of first year students as directed by the Ministry of Youth
      Affairs
      Sports, Government of India, its impact can be felt in all parts of the nation and beyond. This year, for the
      first
      time, we were able to spread smiles among the Syrian, Iraqi and Yazidi kids in UN refugee camps through
      collaboration
      with Letters of Love. We started working on the innovations of grassroot level innovators and presented our work
      at
      Rashtrapati Bhavan during festival of innovation. We have reached the students of remote places of India
      including
      naxal affected areas, who use our educa- tional videos for studying in regional languages. We also reached to the
      school
      children across the states of india through The Artistic impact- a pan India competition thereby introducing
      these
      young minds to NSS as a platform for social service. We connected to people of all age groups for creating a
      community
      to promote gardening and nature lovers interests.</p>
    <p>We increased our reach inside Mumbai as well by reaching to NGOs and schools by demonstrating various
      sustainable
      ways of living. Collected cloth, on donation to the underprivileged people on the outskirts of the city, helped
      us
      spread the smiles. Thus, composed of five departments working towards creating better life, Educational Outreach,
      Events,
      Green Campus, National Innovational Club and Vikas, the activities of NSS IIT Bombay are varied and cover almost
      all
      aspects of social service. Educating underprivileged students irrespective of language and distance barriers,
      maintaining
      the biodiversity of the campus and reestablishing the bond between young generation and nature, working towards
      environmental
      sustain- ability, improving the life of campus residents, reaching out to the construction workers in the campus
      and
      identifying their problems and working on them, giving support to the grassroot innovators to enable them to
      compete
      with the modern technologies and bring light upon their innovations are some of the major activities undertaken
      by
      NSS IITB.</p>
    <p>Spreading happiness through community service has been one of the primary objectives of NSS. With innovative
      activities
      across the departments catering to all classes of the campus residents, we try to cre- ate small, happy and
      memorable
      moments in their lives. And working in NSS itself has been one of the prime sources of happiness for the people
      associated
      with us. Bringing to light the stories of the different campus residents who are responsible for its smooth
      functioning
      and also the stories of our volunteers has also been a major and a very popular activity undertaken by NSS, IITB.</p>

        <h1 class="header">Educational Outreach</h1>
        <p>Educational Outreach is the department of NSS, IITB that strives to ensure that every child receives the
          formal
          education she or he is entitled to. We at Educational Outreach believe that lack of education is one of the
          biggest
          root cause of all existing problems in the society. Also, acknowledging the fact that formal education is not
          enough
          for the all-round development of a child, initiatives like Muskaan and Prayog were started to train the
          students
          in extra-curricular activities and to develop their scientific temperament respectively. Also, this
          department
          has national outreach due to its YouTube channel, Open Learning Initiative. Voice for Purpose is another
          online
          initiative wherein books, travel diaries and current affairs news are recorded as audio books for the blind
          students.
          With a new initiative - Neem Schools for this year, which focuses on value education as the most important
          aspect
          of education, this department is constantly trying to make overall learning more fun, interesting and
          enriching.
          From the mess workers of the institute to the children of remote parts of India, the beneficiaries of this
          department
          are varied and large in number.</p>

          <strong>About the initiative:</strong>
          <p> OLI is a You Tube channel that was launched by NSS, IITB to ensure that language does not become a
            barrier
            in education. With educational videos recorded by our volunteers (mostly UG students in their first, second
            or
            third years) in regional languages, we aim to make the Internet equally useful for students who don’t study
            in
            English medium schools. Currently, the channel contains 250+ educational videos on Science and Mathematics
            in
            eight Indian languages, namely, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Odia, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu.
            There
            is also a course on English to benefit the students and a section on scientific experiments, wherein
            interesting
            and informative experiments are demonstrated to enhance the interest of the students in science and to
            promote
            scientific temperament and another section on fun facts and interesting concepts(Edutainment).</p>

          <strong>Ideation:</strong>
          <p>The idea of launching this YouTube channel was born out of a discussion with a nearby NGO, Vidya. They
            were
            on the lookout for educational videos in Hindi and Marathi. They had AV facilities and hence they could
            have
            shown those videos to students in the absence of teachers. However, thorough search on the internet did not
            produce
            satisfactory results and most of the good videos were in English. That's when we thought of starting our
            own
            YouTube channel.</p>

          <br><br>
          <strong>Outreach:</strong>
          <p> The growth of OLI has been exponential in the last year. Starting from 300 subscribers, OLI has grown to
            about
            50k subscribers and 4.2 million+ views. Many NGOs in Powai like Vidya, Asha, Logic Center and Community
            Welfare
            Association (LCCWA) etc. are using our videos for teaching their students. LCCWA has regular OLI sessions
            for
            students on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Many people from other parts of the nation have also been availing our
            resources.This
            is what Diwakaran sir from LCCWA had to say about OLI:</p>
          <q><cite>OLI is a fantastic tool for learning Math specially for 8th std students. As it is in Hindi language
              and
              is for the vernacular medium, it is very easy for them to understand the concepts </cite></q>

        <div id="teach" class="collapse">
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;">About:</strong> Teaching can be considered as the foundation stone of
            Educational
            Outreach. Our volunteers visit various NGOs in and around the campus to teach the students enrolled there.</p>
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;"> Outreach:</strong> The NGOs currently involved with us are Vidya
            (having
            5 centers), Asha, Logic Center and Community Welfare Association (LCCWA) and Computer Literacy Program
            (CLP)
            with 8 centers in all. A total of more than 70 volunteers taught more than 300 students in these centers. A
            continuous
            assessment program was carried out in NGOs by the implementation of log books to keep a record of every
            student’s
            academic growth. The teaching program was carried out in summer and winter vacations also with the aid of
            non-freshmen
            volunteers. 2 NGOs were functional with 20+ volunteers teaching a variety of subjects.</p>
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;">The way forward:</strong> We plan to extend our volunteering to more
            NGOs
            in near future (distance of the NGO from the campus is a major constraint in this direction). Strengthening
            the
            ties between NGOs and NSS will also be focused on by helping out the NGOs with planning their summer camps
            and
            youth fests successfully.</p>

        <div id="muskaan" class="collapse">
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;">About:</strong> Muskaan was started with the aim of
            training
            children in cultural activities like dance and fine arts thus, contributing towards their all-round
            development.
            This year we incorporated a well-defined curriculum in all genres to ensure a robust learning experience.
            Quilling,
            origami, cotton-painting and blow-painting were some of the fine arts activities while bolly-hop and
            hip-hop
            were the major dance forms taught in the last year. Their efforts were showcased through a dance
            performance
            for All NSS Meet and through a fine arts submission for Kaladarshan 2018. Muskaan sessions are held every
            Sunday.
            We also had non-freshmen volunteers participating in this initiative over the course of two semesters.</p>
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;">Outreach:</strong> Over 100 students from 3 NGOs benefited from
            Muskaan</p>
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;">The Way Forward:</strong> It has been planned to expand Muskaan to
            music
            and literary arts. Also, we aim at reaching out to more NGOs in near future. Better collaboration with the
            Institute
            Cultural Council and hence increased productivity in genres like Dramatics will be sought for.</p>

          <!-- do something -->
          <p>
            Prayog was started with a belief that science is better understood by demonstration. Our aim is to instill
            scientific temperament
            among the students by the means of simple, yet interesting and informative scientific experiments. The
            students
            get a chance to perform the experiments themselves after the demonstration. Also, care is taken to ensure
            that
            the experiments are performed with readily available apparatus so that the students can easily replicate
            them
            when they go home. All the experiments are followed by an explanation of the scientific principles on which
            the
            experiment is based. We included mental ability section this time with quizzes and puzzles and fun
            activities.
            This year the students were also taken to various technical exhibitions inside the IIT campus to ignite
            their
            curiosity and inspire them towards science.

            This program was started on the request of security guards to teach them the basics of English. We have
            come a long way since
            then and ALP has been extended to mess workers. We have even expanded the curriculum to make it more
            relatable
            to the workers’ needs. We now have included basic mathematics and basic knowledge (going cashless, how to
            fill
            forms etc ) for the benefit of the workers. Currently, mess workers and PHO workers in Hostels – 2, 3, 6,
            7,
            8, 9, 10 are benefiting from this program. We distributed dictionaries and notebooks to the mess workers to
            facilitate
            their learning process. We have been receiving a very positive response for the program and the workers
            have
            shown commendable enthusiasm towards learning
          </p>
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;">Outreach:</strong> Currently, 50+ mess workers from 7 hostels are a
            part
            of this program.</p>
          <p><strong style="padding-right: 5px;">The Way Forward:</strong> We plan on structuring ALP by making more
            robust
            and thorough teaching modules which will be modified with time. Also, expanding ALP to the rest of the
            hostels
            and possibly to construction workers will be the next move.</p>

            is
            missed out. We were introduced to this idea by WhiteSwan Neem School foundation, a Delhi based
            organisation,
            who wanted to start neem schools in Mumbai. After proper induction and training, we took this initiative
            up.
            Currently we are functioning in Gokhale Nagar Maidan (opposite IIT Main Gate) and have 40+ children from
            around
            the slums attending these Sunday morning sessions. Every session starts with a prayer, followed by
            instructions
            for proper hygiene maintenance which then is followed by the session on moral value of the day. Interesting
            stories
            and interactive activities are used to get the moral message to the kids and at last the session ends with
            a
            prayer. Many a times parents of the kids come by to see the sessions progressing and give feedback to
            improve
            the sessions.</p>

            area ( to the left of Y Point gate) and starting these sessions in collaboration with NGOs operating in the
            areas

            Associates
            of the departments, under the supervision of the Department Heads. Volunteers are included in the donation
            activities
            Every year, the initiative is held in the months of May and June, as it is the time when the academic year
            ends
            and the students leave. This year, the donation activities were held in the slum areas of Ambernath.</p>

            further
            broken down to 2 phases- Phase 1, held in October involves collection from the student hostels, which
            includes
            making of interactive donation boxes by the volunteers, putting them up in visible, common areas in each
            hostel
            followed by regular collection of the donated items. Phase 2, held in March, is conducted in the professor
            residences,
            the volunteers are divided into specific groups and allotted specific areas, where at first publicity
            posters
            are put up, followed by 4-5 visits in the areas to collect clothes from the interested people. In both the
            phases,
            segregation and sorting of clothes are done by the volunteers itself. The activity is most enjoyed by
            volunteers
            as they themselves are responsible for all the collection, the sorting and the donation activities done in

            donated. The phase 1 donations were again carried out in the slum areas of Ambernath, with the help of The

            fact
            that the canteens do not always provide the change and the buyer must sometime reluctantly take different
            items
            with them. The MoC provided an alternate platform for the same, purchasing biscuits from that change and
            donating
            it the donation boxes provided there by NSS. The first activity of the academic year for the volunteers,
            this
            included making of interactive donation boxes, coaxing the various canteen owners to allow the boxes to be
            kept
            in canteens, and then regular collection by the volunteers. This year, the initiative was held in some of
            the
            department canteens and some hostel canteens. As a trial run, the MoC was also held outside the institute,
            to
            cater to a more diverse audience. The total collection was close to 300 packets, donated at the Aman Day
            Care
            center in the institute and the Akshay Patra supported schools in Thane, as an additive to their morning
            breakfast.

          Mapping
        </button>
        <div id="biodiversity" class="collapse">
          <p>Biodiversity mapping is the idea of locating the exact position of trees in given area and creating a
            database
            out of it. This is important in long term as it gives us the data trends of each species of the tree like
            which
            species are increasing or decreasing in number. This database can be created as per area. We can search for
            reasons
            of these data trends and take corrective measures if required. Student community in the campus have a huge
            set
            of activities which they can participate in and this causes them to pay very little attention to the huge
            biodiversity
            they pass by daily. We thought there can be an easy way of making this biodiversity data available to the
            community
            where they do not need to invest extra time to acquire it and praise the importance. So in addition to
            mapping
            the trees, we chose main road inside the campus and put the placards on trees bearing their names and
            specialty.
            Thus the information of biodiversity along the road is now made available to all the passers-by.</p>
          <p>We started the work by taking “Study of the Biodiversity of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Campus”
            by
            WWF as the basic data. It was the data from 2008-09. We took the names of the trees from that report and
            made
            a database of their images with the help of volunteers. Later, we started identifying the trees in the main
            roadside.
            Volunteers also tried to explain the speciality of the tree through one liner info. Eventually, we put the
            common
            name, scientific name and speciality of the tree on the placard and put these placards on the trees. Care
            was
            taken so that no tree was harmed by the activity.</p>
          <p>This year in this initiative, to improvise, we used one sided paper for this activity which were collected
            from
            different departments and academic area. More than 1200 placards were labeled. Also this time the placards
            were
            digitised by introduction of QR codes which when scanned redirects to Greenopedia (an online database).</p>

          <p>It is an unique way of plantation in which saplings were planted in the used coconut shells. Also when
            transplanted
            with the shell, the coconut degrades in the soil thereby providing nutrients. We collected more than 50
            empty
            coconuts from the institute and planted Balsam saplings in them. In this process, we made holes in the
            bottom
            of the coconut, filled it with mud and planted the seeds or saplings in it. The holes in the coconut helped
            the
            roots to grow without any obstruction. This activity reduced the usage of the conventional black plastic
            covers

            got condensed and went into the beds once again. This helped to keep the bed wet for almost 2-3 days after

            they
            face regarding the same on the forum. Apart from queries and discussion, people can share any interesting

            about gardening and want to try out different techniques and explore the field. But very few know where to
            start!
            The need was felt for guidance and a platform for all the people who are enthusiastic about exploring
            gardening.
            This need gave rise to the idea of Prakriti-A forum for discussion and knowledge sharing.This year a new
            category
            named 'Nature and Festivals' was started under which posts on significance of nature in celebrating various
            festivals
            were made.</p>
          <p>Prakriti was started as a google group in August 2016. After starting the blog of NSS, the informative
            posts
            on Prakriti are also shared on the blog. Some of the notable informative posts in Prakriti involved Largest
            trees-
            Redwoods, Resurrection of the plants-a story of how plants survive the harsh summer, Hemp: A sustainable
            leap
            or Narcotic, Medicinal plants in NSS Nursery and communication among honey bees. This year we also started
            a
            new category named 'Nature and Festivals' under which we discuss the significance of nature in celebrating
            various
            festivals. Under this, we have covered 'Holi', 'Makar Sankranti','Diwali' etc. Some people also came up
            with
            their queries like cutting of the trees, initiation of a nursery in hostel 13. Till date we have
            approximately
            300 members. We hope to reach out to people who are more proactive so that they can help solve the queries
            of
            group members whenever required.</p>

            postgraduate
            or Ph.D students. These volunteers helped in watering and regular maintenance of the nursery during the

            uncontrolled
            irrigation promoting water conservation and reducing the environmental impacts.</p>
          <p> This prototype avoids water wastage by providing only the required amount of water needed based on the
            moisture
            level of the soil which is constantly monitored by sensors. The data obtained from the sensors is processed
            by
            an Arduino micro controller that signals a valve controlling the water flow. We have also developed an user
            interface
            in form of an Android Application that displays the current moisture levels of the soil and enables the
            user
            to change the threshold values. The application connects with the Arduino micro controller using a
            Bluetooth

            minimal
            effort. As residents of Mumbai, we observed that there were frequent short lived floodings due to heavy
            rains
            in the city. We took up the idea to transfer the technology used by N Shakthimaithan to the meet the urban
            needs.
            To understand the real need and requirements from such a product by an urban area, we conducted a number of
            surveys
            in nearby areas. We received positive feedbacks on the idea. On researching various mechanisms, we adopted
            the
            Reciprocating Mechanism which was best suited to our needs. We created a CAD model of the pump design and
            optimized
            its design to gain maximum work output. We also made the device more cheaper and portable. We are currently
            working
            on creating a prototype based on the improved designs.</p>

            Bombay.
            Apart from this, 6 hostels enthusiastically celebrated the festival with the eco friendly idols made in he
            staff
            club leading to minimum pollution. Some people also decided to travel an extra mile on the eco friendly
            road
            and chose to put seeds inside the idols which where then immersed in a pot rather than water bodies and
            grown
            into beautiful plants. The idols made by NSS volunteers were distributed among the PHO workers assisting
            them
            to celebrate festival in an economical as well as eco-friendly way.</p>
